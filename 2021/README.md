## Summary of puzzle concepts
The following are my high-level simplifications of the given tasks. Check the `subjectXX` file (in each day's directory) for the official assignment texts.

| Day | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 |Get rolling sum from a series of ints. Compare delta of sums and return number of increases.|
| 2 |Add vectors together.|
| 3 |Filter out unwanted values and do a little bit (pun intended) of bit manipulation to the results.|
| 4 |Bingo grid reader. Determine winning and losing grid based on bingo numbers.|
| 5 |Draw horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines on a 2D grid and count the overlaps.|
| 6 |Simulate exponential growth based on two variables whose values change based on simple rules.|
| 7 |Calculate sum of distances to the median and the mean of a dataset.|
| 8 |Decryption. Straightforward logical deduction rather than clever code.|
| 9 |Implement a flood fill algorithm.|
| 10 |Find matching brackets. FILO stack.|
| 11 |Cellular automata / game-of-lifey simulation.|
| 12 |Count paths on a graph (DFS).|
| 13 |Perform a logical OR on binary vectors and count the 1s.|
